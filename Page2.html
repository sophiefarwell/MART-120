             <h1>My Short Story</h1>
             <p class="content">My little Cousin and I always have the best times at our family reuions. Her name is Presely and she loves all things girly. Pres as we like to call her, usally will have me play with her barbies. The barbies always are on there way to some ball or dance so we dress them in the nicest dresses. Barbies peaks her interest for a short moment until she realizes that I have a phone. My phone is not kid prof, meaning that I have any games so she usally has to keep to my notes app. On the notes app you can use it as canvas which was excatly what she did. She spent 30 mins on my phone and probaly used a good 15% of my battery but anything for my little cousin. We laugh at our drawings as we layed on the grass. It was a beauitful Sunday and all was right it a perfect world. It always makes me feel like a kid again when I get to see her. Hopefullly she will never grow up and we can play barbies and draw forever. These images are her actually drawings and I will cherish them forever. </p>
